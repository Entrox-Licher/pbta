# Description

Build campaigns compatible with (most) [Powered by the Apocalypse RPGs](http://apocalypse-world.com/pbta/) using Foundry VTT! This system is in active development, and it currently has three versions: a public beta version, a patreon beta version, and a patreon alpha version. There is no difference between the versions aside from the feature release cadence (described later in the Patreon section of this readme).

# Installation

To install the free beta version, use this manifest URL in Foundry's system installer.

**System Manifest:** [https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/pbta/-/jobs/artifacts/beta/raw/system.json?job=build-beta](https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/pbta/-/jobs/artifacts/beta/raw/system.json?job=build-beta)

To install a patreon alpha or beta version, follow the instructions available via the Iron Moose Development patreon and/or Discord server.

# Supporting Development at Patreon

If you would like to support the development of this system and get access to its new features sooner, you can subscribe to the [Iron Moose Development Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ironmoose), and where you can get Patreon alpha and/or beta access to the PbtA system, along with several other systems and modules!

Release cycles for the project follow this pattern:

1. Patreon alpha version releases with new features.
2. One week later, the patreon beta version releases with those same features (along with bug fixes).
3. Two weeks later (three weeks since alpha), the new features will be released in a new public beta version.
