# 0.8.2

## Features and Changes

- Added support for token instead of stats, for games like Apocalypse keys and Libret√©. character.stats block should have token = true, label = "token name", an optional default = [number] which define the default token value for new character and max = [number] which defines the max number of token a character can have.

# 0.8.1

## Features and Changes

- **Deprecation Warning** Added new tags setting configuration. This can be accessed under the PbtA settings and is separate from the TOML config setting. Tag settings are intended as a replacement for tag items and module devs should plan to replace their compendium tags by defining tags in `game.pbta.tagConfigOverride`. See the updated [README.md](https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/pbta/-/blob/master/README.md) for an example.
- Added support for shifting results of rolls. To enable this, add `rollShifting = true` to your TOML config (at the same level as `rollFormula` and other global TOML settings).
- Added a Hide Sidebar buttons setting.
- Removed the ability to create Tag items and added a warning on Tag item sheets.
- Removed the "Welcome to the Alpha" header from the Sheet Configuration and update the notes.

## Bug Fixes
- Changed List's multi-checkbox to accept spaces in-between the label (e.g. `Condition | 3`).
- Fixed Speaker and RollMode not being set on rolls.
- Fixed Forward/Ongoing making rolls fail if no condition is set.
- Fixed NPC Move Rolls not showing Result Ranges.
- Fixed Stat Toggle only setting toggled stats' values to 0.

# 0.8.0

- Removed support for Foundry v10. Version 0.8.0 and above will be for Foundry v11+
- Added Tracks (@n1xx1)
- Added image to items based on their types.
- Added tooltips to Lists.

# 0.6.1

## Bug Fixes

- #78: Fixed an issue where enriched HTML (such as description or move results fields) didn't allow item links to be rendered correctly. One example of this issue was that if an item was created and then dropped into the description field of another item, it would output as plain text instead of as a link to the item.
